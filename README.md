Project initialized via `expo init`, using the typescript blank template.

Subsequently, the following commands were run to add react-navigation:
- `yarn add @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack`
- `expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context`
- `npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler`

Run the project using
- `yarn ios`

Moving forward, please use `npx create-expo-app --template`.
